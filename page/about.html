            Heroes Support Fund is a dedicated nonprofit organization committed
            to supporting United States military personnel and their families,
            both those serving overseas in conflict zones and those stationed
            domestically.
          </p>

          <p>
            Founded in 2020, we recognized the critical need for immediate,
            direct assistance to military families facing financial hardships,
            medical challenges, and emotional struggles that come with military
            service.
          </p>
