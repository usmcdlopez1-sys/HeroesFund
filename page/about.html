            Heroes Support Fund is a dedicated nonprofit organization committed
            to supporting the United States military personnel and their
            families, both those serving overseas in conflict zones and those
            stationed domestically.
          </p>

          <p>
            Founded in 2020, we recognized the critical need for immediate,
            direct assistance to military families facing financial hardships,
            medical challenges, and emotional struggles that come with military
            service.

            Our Mission
          </h2>
          <p>
            We honor sacrifice by empowering lives. Our mission is to provide
            dedicated financial and logistical support to active-duty service
            members, veterans, military families, and wounded warriors when they
            need it most. We believe that when a service member or their family
            faces hardship, the civilian community has a duty to stand with
            them. We translate your generosity directly into emergency grants,
            educational scholarships, and therapeutic services.
          </p>

            Our Stories and Values
          </h2>
          <p>
            <b>Our Story:</b>
            Our organization was founded in 2022 by a group of concerned
            citizens and retired military officers who recognized a gap in
            support for veterans struggling with PTSD. What started as a small,
            local effort has grown into a National movement driven by a simple,
            profound commitment: never leave a hero behind.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Our Values:</b>

            Integrity: We operate with total transparency, ensuring every dollar
            is maximized for our beneficiaries.
            <br />Respect: We serve our community with the honor and dignity
            they deserve. <br />Impact: We focus on measurable results and
            providing direct, meaningful assistance.
          </p>

              <strong>Important Note:</strong> When you donate to HEROESFUND,
              you are directly funding programs that change lives. Your support
              provides: $50 could cover the gas for a veteran to attend a week
              of critical job interviews. $500 could provide an emergency grant
              to a military family to keep their utilities on while they await
              government assistance. $5,000 could fund a full scholarship for a
              military spouse to complete a certification program, leading to a
              stable career.
